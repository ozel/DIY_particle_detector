# DIY Particle Detector 
## Electron-Detector Variant

This open hardware project is a mobile low-cost detector for measuring 
ionising radiation like electrons from beta radiation (plus some gamma photons).
It's an educational tool and citizen science device made for exploring 
natural and synthetic sources of radioactivity such as stones, airborne radon, 
potassium-rich salt or food and every-day objects (Uranium glass, old Radium watches etc.).

The other [alpha-spectrometer variant](https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/ozel/diy_particle_detector/diy%20alpha%20spectrometer) of this 
project can measure the energy spectrum of alpha particles but is more difficult 
to operate. Both versions of the DIY Particle Detector are using the same circuit board with different sets of components.

Please refer to the [main project description](https://github.com/ozel/DIY_particle_detector/) for further details.
