# DIY Particle Detector  v
## Alpha-Spectrometer Variant

This open hardware project is a mobile low-cost spectrometer for measuring ionising radiation like alpha particles and electrons (energy range: 33 keV to 8 MeV).
It's an educational tool and citizen science device made for exploring natural and synthetic sources of radioactivity such as stones, airborne radon, potassium-rich salt or food and every-day objects (Uranium glass, old Radium watches etc.).

The other electron-detector variant of this project is easier to operate but cannot measure alpha particles.
Both versions of the DIY Particle Detector are using the same circuit board with different sets of components.
